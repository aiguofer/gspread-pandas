[Unreleased]
------------
[2.1.0] - 2019-07-10
-----------------------------

Added
-----

-  Client now has an optional ``load_dirs`` param which default to ``False``

Changed
-------

-  BREAKING: Refactored ``Spread`` into its own file. If you were importing
   like ``from gspread_pandas.client import Spread`` you will need to change
   to ``from gspread_pandas.spread import Spread``.
-  Directories and paths are no longer loaded by default. However, if you try
   to use any functionality that requires it, it'll load it at that point.

Fixed
-----

-  If a file doesn't have ``parents`` it'll no longer break (thanks @shredding)
   (`#29 <https://github.com/aiguofer/gspread-pandas/issues/29>`_)
-  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME should now be respected
-  If you don't have Drive API access in the scope, it should now still work and
   print a message instead


[2.0.0] - 2019-06-12
-----------------------------

Added
-----

-  Test python 3.7, Windows, and MacOS
-  You can now iterate over worksheets like: ``for sheet in spread``
-  ``Spread.df_to_sheet`` can now flatten multi-level headers using the
   ``flatten_headers_sep`` param
-  Add ability to set permissions on spreadsheets
-  Add ability to create and move folders and spreadsheets
-  A session can now be passed directly to a ``Client``
-  A ``raw_column_names`` param to ``Spread.df_to_sheet`` to force specific
   columns to be sent to the Google Sheets API as RAW input so it doesn't
   get interpreted as a number, date, etc.

Removed
-------

-  BREAKING: Removed ``start/end_row/col`` params from add_filter
-  BREAKING: Removed ``user_creds_or_client`` param from Spread
-  BREAKING: Removed ``user_or_creds`` param from Client

Changed
-------

-  The ``credentials`` param is now called ``creds`` everywhere
-  Test suite is now a lot more robust
-  Use google-auth instead of the now deprecated oauth2client library.
   This moves the retry code into that library.
-  Default config will now be in ``C:\Users\<user>\AppData\gspread_pandas``
   on Windows


Fixed
-----

-  Things should now work when passing a ``Worksheet`` object to ``Spread.open``


[1.3.1] - 2019-05-17
-----------------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

-  Passing 0 to ``sheet``` param in any function should work now
-  When using multi-row column headers in a spreadsheet, the index name
   should now be better identified
-  Spread;update_cells should now work when passing a single cell value
-  When start != 'A1', freeze_rows/headers should now correctly freeze
   the right amount of rows/headers so the index and columns are frozen

[1.3.0] - 2019-04-30
-----------------------------

Added
~~~~~

-  Function to merge_cells
-  Function to unmerge_cells
-  Option to merge_headers in df_to_sheet
-  Retry when exceeding the 100s quota

Fixed
~~~~~

-  Fix passing 0 for freeze_index or freeze_headers. This essentially
   "unfreezes"
-  When the index has no name and you have a multi-level header, it will
   no longer fill in "index" as the index header

Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~

-  Spread will no longer use the 'user_creds_or_client' param in v2. Instead, it
   will have optional 'credentials', 'client', and 'user' params. If creds or a
   client are passed, the user will be ignored. Otherwise, it'll use the user,
   which will default to "default"
-  Client will no longer use the 'user_or_creds' param in v2. Instead, it
   will have optional 'credentials' and 'user' params. If creds passed, the user
   will be ignored. Otherwise, it'll use the user, which will default to "default"
-  Spread.add_filter will be standardized to use 'start' and 'end' like other
   functions and the start/end_row/col are deprecated and will be removed in v2

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  Exceptions are no longer raised while handling another exception. This should
   prevent the "During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred"
   message
-  When opening a new Spreadsheet, the SpreadsheetNotFound exception will no longer
   be a "catchall" for any errors. If an error other than actually not finding the
   Spreadsheet occurs, it'll be raised.
-  Default value for the user param in util.get_config was changed to "default"
